`go-term-text` is a go package implementing a collection of algorithms to help format and manipulate text for the terminal.

In particular, `go-term-text`:
- support wide characters (chinese, japanese ...) and emoji
- handle properly ANSI escape sequences

Included algorithms cover:
- wrapping with padding and indentation
- padding
- text length
- trimming
- alignment
- escape sequence extraction and reapplication
- escape sequence snapshot and simplification
- truncation

## Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"

	"github.com/MichaelMure/go-term-text"
)

func main() {
	input := "The \x1b[1mLorem ipsum\x1b[0m text is typically composed of " +
    		"pseudo-Latin words. It is commonly used as \x1b[3mplaceholder\x1b[0m" +
    		" text to examine or demonstrate the \x1b[9mvisual effects\x1b[0m of " +
    		"various graphic design. 一只 A Quick \x1b[31m敏捷的狐 Fox " +
    		"狸跳过了\x1b[0mDog一只懒狗。"

	output, n := text.Wrap(input, 60,
            text.WrapIndent("\x1b[34m<-indent-> \x1b[0m"),
            text.WrapPad("\x1b[33m<-pad-> \x1b[0m"),
    )

	fmt.Printf("output has %d lines\n\n", n)

	fmt.Println("|" + strings.Repeat("-", 58) + "|")
	fmt.Println(output)
	fmt.Println("|" + strings.Repeat("-", 58) + "|")
}
```

This will print:
